This repository features a simple, small PCB intended to convert 5V USB C power to 3.3V in a small form-factor
Please note that R1 is optional, see schematics for details, and it should be tested if it is required in your project.

The design LDO makes it capable of draw a maximum of 1A of current at 3.3V.
A ferrite bead and some capacitors offers some smoothing of potential ripples in voltage and it should also be tested for your project. Very current intensive projects may require bigger or more capacitors.
